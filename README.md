# CASE group

Welcome to the organization page of the CASE group (Cellular Adventures in Simulated Environments). You'll not find much here at the moment, but the organization repositories will fill over time with scripts related to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with a focus on applications for bioprocesses.

We work on hydrodynamic simulation of bubble columns, airlifts, stirred tank reactors and microfluidics. In these systems, we are interested in the experience of the microorganism - the fluctuations in substrate concentrations and shear stress that they experience, and the impact these have on the cellular performance.

Our interests include novel gas fermentation, classical aerated fermentations and cellular agriculture, and we combine computational approaches with experimental validation.
